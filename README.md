# Cry Detection for Smart Baby Cradle 👶🎵

A machine learning-based cry detection system built using audio signal processing and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. This model is designed to be integrated into a Smart Baby Cradle, enabling real-time detection of infant cries and responsive caregiving actions.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The primary goal is to distinguish between **cry** and **non-cry** audio using features extracted from baby sound samples. This system is intended to enhance a smart cradle's capabilities by allowing it to react intelligently to a baby's emotional state.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time audio classification using trained SVM
- ✅ Preprocessed `.wav` files for cry vs. non-cry detection
- ✅ MFCC feature extraction from audio samples
- ✅ Evaluation via accuracy and confusion matrix
- ✅ Ready for integration with IoT/Embedded Systems

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Librosa – audio processing
- NumPy, Pandas – data handling
- Scikit-learn – model training
- Matplotlib – visualization

## 📊 Output

- **Accuracy:** ~95% on test data
- **Confusion Matrix:** Clear separation between cry and non-cry
- **Significance:** Ensures cradle responds only to real crying, avoiding false triggers

---

## 💡 Integration Idea

This model can be deployed on an embedded system like Raspberry Pi or ESP32 with microphone input. When a cry is detected, the cradle can:

- Start gentle rocking
- Alert a parent via mobile notification
- Record logs for monitoring
